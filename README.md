# ml-charityml

This project applies supervised learning on the data collected by the US census to help a fictitious 
charity organization called CharityML to identify the people most likely to donate to their cause. 

The process involves preprocessing of the data (transformation, normalization and hot-encoding), 
evaluating a few supervised learners to find the most suitable one for the project and 
optimizing the model via grid search.
